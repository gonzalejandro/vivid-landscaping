                    <h3>Tree Removal Companies</h3>
                    <p>Many tree removal companies subcontract stump grinding. When removing a tree for a homeowner or industrial site, call us to grind up the stumps and create a fresh, clean site.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Cement Contractors</h3>
                    <p>Tree stumps or large roots can pose a problem when laying a foundation for new construction. Our stump grinders make short work of these obstacles in very little time. Don't waste your time trying to figure out how to get rid of an unexpected root or stump—just give us a call. Many times we can eliminate the problem in a couple of hours.</p>

                    <h3>Fence Companies</h3>
                    <p>We can also remove roots that are in the way of putting in a new fence. Most people believe that a stump grinder only grinds a stump down level with the ground, but that is not true. We can grind deep into the ground and create a hole for the fence post to go in.</p>

                    <h3>Landscape Companies</h3>
                    <p>Old roots and pieces of long ago removed trees and shrubs can interfere with laying new sod or putting in new trees and shrubs. In this case, our stump removal equipment can come in and grind up those old roots and stumps and leave an area of fresh turned soil with no obstacles.</p>

                    <p>Have you tried putting in a few shrubs or a fence yourself, or perhaps you're digging a rat wall for a new shed and have run into old tree roots or a stump? Give us a call. Our services won't break your bank and we can have you back to your real project in no time. Don't hurt your back and waste your time trying to dig those roots and stumps out yourself. What is your time worth? Give us a call and let us do it for you.</p>
